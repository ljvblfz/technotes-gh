\subsection{资源配置}
Static configuration of the hardware resources are controlled by the include file "cvmx-config.h". This file is generated from the executive-config.h file and other files in the config directory of the application. 
Example: creating an application that uses simple executive
\begin{shellcmd}
% mkdir application
% cd application
% mkdir config
% cp $OCTEON_ROOT/executive/executive-config.h.template config/executive-config.h
\end{shellcmd}
(then edit config/executive-config.h to tune the flags/settings as appropriate for the application)
